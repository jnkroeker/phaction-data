#### Python Virtual Environment must be created and notebook, requests, urllib3 packages
#### installed to execute script in this project

1. Create a virtual environment by selecting a directory in which it will live and execute:

   `python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment`

2. Once venv is created, activate it:

   `source /path/to/new/virtual/environment/bin/activate`

3. Install required packages once venv is activated:

   `pip install gradio fastai ipywidgets matplotlib notebook openpyxl nbdev numpy pandas requests scikit-learn urllib3`
	
#### On your laptop, John: venv is in ~/phaction/  
#### Activate it with `source ~/phaction/bin/activate`
#### Exit venv with   `deactivate`

### parse_sugarwod_data.ipynb

SugarWOD data is provided as CSV. With python, we can easily parse csv into dataframes and start working with it.

No scripting required to get hold of the data, just go directly to jupyter notebook.

### GoPro Data

Could not get Open GoPro API working with `extract_gopro_media.py` script. Defaulting to reading the SD card.
